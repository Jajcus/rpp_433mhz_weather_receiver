# Raspberry Pi Pico based receiver for 433 MHz weather sensors

## Overview

This repository contains code for a simple Raspberry-Pi based 433 Mhz receiver for weather data from remote sensors of cheap 'weather stations' intended to provide data for Home Assistant via serial over USB.


## State of the project

This is one-off project for my own needs, which I would like to share for anyone interested. It is one of my first Rust projects, so the code is probably quite bad.

The code uses a great, but highly experimental [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) framework, which, in turn, depends on nightly features of the Rust compiler. It may stop working with future official Rust releases.

Use on your own risk.
